This program is just for downloading your videos or these ones you are allowed to,
I take no responsibility for your action!

This program is based on program youtube-dl, check their work and you can also support them

Hi and thanks for downloading this program,
before we start, let me tell you something about how it all works.

So let's start with graphic interface, there is one entry,
two option menu and one button.
Option menu is for choosing format of downloading file and
second one is for choosing how and what to download.

Unoma means that you want to download file just by inserting url address of youtube video
PlayList means you want do download whole playlist, just insert url adress of wanted playlist.
File means that you want to download all files from file appended by url addresses of youtube videos, one url on each line

Where does downtube downloads files?
That depends where you are. Go to folder and then type "downtube" and everything you download will be there.

Text interface is little bit easier, you will be asked for everything what is needed
Use this command to enter to downtube in text-mode "downtube -t"
