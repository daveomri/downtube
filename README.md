This program is just for downloading your videos or these ones you are allowed to from the YouTube,
I take no responsibility for your action!

Downtube is based on program youtube-dl, check their work and you can also support them

Hi and thanks for downloading downtube,
before we start, let me tell you something about how it all works.

So let's start with graphic interface, there is one entry,
two options menu and one button.
First option menu is for choosing format of downloading file and
second one is for choosing how and what to download.

Unoma means that you want to download file just by inserting url address of youtube video
Unoma == extract audio or video from one video from YouTube
PlayList means you want do download whole playlist, just insert url adress of wanted playlist.
PlayList == extract video or audio from all videos in playlist
File means that you want to download all files from file appended by url addresses of youtube videos, one url on each line

start of example of file/
<url>
<url>
<url>
/end of example file

Where does downtube downloads files?
Right to file, where you are. So to download anything do to specific folder and then type "downtube" and everything you download will be there.

Text interface is little bit easier. Program asks you for everything what is important.
Use this command to enter to downtube in text-mode "downtube -t"
